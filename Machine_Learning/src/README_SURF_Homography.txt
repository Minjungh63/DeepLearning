(2) SURT_Homography.cpp
-purpose: Features2D+Homography opencv 2.4 version source code.
-how to run this code: 
	1. prepare two images to match.
	2. wait untill all the results come out.
-steps:
	1. Detect the keypoints using SURF Detector.
	2. Calculate descriptors (feature vectors).
	3. Matching descriptor vectors using FLANN matcher.
	4. Draw only "good" matches (i.e. whose distance is less than 3*min_dist ) and get the keypoints from the good matches.
	5. Get the corners from the image_1 ( the object to be "detected" ) and draw lines between the corners (the mapped object in the scene - image_2 )
