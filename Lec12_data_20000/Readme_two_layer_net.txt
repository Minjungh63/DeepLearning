# purpose: 
develop a neural network with fully-connected layers to perform classification, and test it out on the CIFAR-10 dataset

# contents:
1. Forward pass: compute scores
2. Forward pass: compute loss
3. Backward pass
4. Train the network
5. Load the data
6. Train a network
7. Debug the training
8. Tune your hyperparameters
9. Run on the test set
